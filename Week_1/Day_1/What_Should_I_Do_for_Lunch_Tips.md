### Tips

Try experimenting with the comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `===`, etc.) in the node REPL, which you can launch using the `node` command in Vagrant.

Work on your code iteratively â€“ that means in small pieces. 

To help you figure out how to use `hungry` and `availableTime` inside your function, try outputting their values to the Terminal as follows.

```javascript
function whatToDoForLunch(hungry, availableTime) {
  console.log("hungry is", hungry);
  console.log("availableTime is", availableTime);
}
```

```javascript
const whatToDoForLunch = function(hungry, availableTime) {
  if (hungry) {
    if (availableTime < 20) {
      console.log("Pick something up and eat in back in the Lab or in the kitchen.");
    } else if (availableTime >= 20 && availableTime <= 30) {
      console.log("You deserve a break and could try a place in Gastown.");
    } else if (availableTime > 30) {
      console.log("This is a bootcamp after all and you should probably reconsider.");
    } else {
      console.log("Wait until you're hungry.");
    }
  }
};
```
